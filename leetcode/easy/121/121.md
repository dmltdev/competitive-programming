# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Problem Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

## Constraints

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

## Solution Approach

Single pass approach tracking minimum price and maximum profit.

At each day, we track the minimum price seen so far and calculate the profit if we sold on the current day. We keep track of the maximum profit seen so far.

Algorithm:

1. Track the minimum price encountered so far
2. For each price, calculate potential profit (current price - minimum price)
3. Update maximum profit if current profit is better

```ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
  if (prices.length < 2) return 0;

  let maxProfit = 0;
  let minPrice = prices[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
    minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, prices[i]);
    maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minPrice);
  }

  return maxProfit;
}
```

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
