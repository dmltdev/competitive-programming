# 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

```sql
SELECT e.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Employee m
  ON e.managerId = m.id
WHERE e.salary > m.salary;
```

The solution uses a self-join, which is necessary because both the employees and their managers reside in the same table.

- `FROM Employee e`: treat the table as the source for employees (alias `e`)
- `INNER JOIN Employee m`: treat the same table as the source for managers (alias `m`)
- `ON e.managerId = m.id`: link two copies by matching the employee's manager ID with the manager's actual ID.
- `WHERE e.salary > m.salary`: filter to keep only the rows where the employee's salary is higher than the linked manager's salary.
- `SELECT e.name`: return the name of the employee who meets the criteria.
