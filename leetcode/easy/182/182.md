# 182. Duplicate Emails

```sql
SELECT email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(email) > 1;
```

The solution uses a GROUP BY clause to group the rows by email address and then filters out the groups that have more than one row using the HAVING clause.

- `SELECT email`: select the email column
- `FROM Person`: select from the Person table
- `GROUP BY email`: group the rows by email address
- `HAVING COUNT(email) > 1`: filter to keep only the groups that have more than one row

The result is a list of email addresses that are present in the Person table more than once.
