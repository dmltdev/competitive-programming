# 183. Customers who never order

```sql
SELECT name AS Customers
FROM Customers
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT customerId FROM Orders);
```

The solution uses a subquery to find all customer IDs that have placed orders and then filters out those customers from the list of all customers.

- `SELECT name AS Customers`: select the name column and alias it as "Customers"
- `FROM Customers`: select from the Customers table
- `WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT customerId FROM Orders)`: filter to keep only the rows where the customer ID is not present in the list of customer IDs that have placed orders.

The result is a list of customer names who have never placed an order.
