Table: Weather

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).

-- Solution 1: Using JOIN with DATEDIFF

SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
ON w1.recordDate - w2.recordDate = 1
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;

-- Solution 2: Using LAG Function

WITH PreviousWeatherData AS
(
    SELECT 
        id,
        recordDate,
        temperature,
        LAG(temperature, 1) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS PreviousTemperature,
        LAG(recordDate, 1) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS PreviousRecordDate
    FROM 
        Weather
)

SELECT
    id
FROM
    PreviousWeatherData
WHERE
    temperature > PreviousTemperature
AND
    recordDate = PreviousRecordDate + INTERVAL '1 day';
