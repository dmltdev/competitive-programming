# Reverse Linked List

## Problem
Reverse a singly linked list. Return the new head.
Input:  1 => 2 => 3 => 4 => 5
Output: 5 => 4 => 3 => 2 => 1

## Approach
Iterate through the list once. At each node:

- Save the next node
- Reverse the current node's pointer to point at the previous node
- Move forward

Use three pointers:
- prev: tracks the node before current (becomes new next)
- current: the node being processed
- next: temporary storage for the original next node

## Complexity

Time: O(n) - single pass through list
Space: O(1) - only three pointers

Walk Through
```txt
Initial: 1 → 2 → 3 → null
         ↑
      current

Step 1:  null ← 1   2 → 3 → null
         ↑     ↑    ↑
       prev  curr  next

Step 2:  null ← 1 ← 2   3 → null
                ↑   ↑   ↑
              prev curr next

Step 3:  null ← 1 ← 2 ← 3
                        ↑
                      prev (return this)
