## 27. Remove Element

[27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

    Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
    Return k.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

 

Constraints:

- 0 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 50
- 0 <= val <= 100

## Solution 1: Slow/Fast Pointer

The solution uses the slow-fast pointer pattern, also called the two-pointer same-direction technique or write-read pointer approach.

`k` (slow/write pointer) - tracks where to write the next valid element
`i` (fast/read pointer) - scsans through the entiry array

The slow pointer `k` only advances when we find a valid element (not equal to `val`).
The fast pointer `i` always advances, reading every element.

- Both pointers start at 0
- Fast pointer reads each element
- If element is valid (not `val`), copy it to the position `k` and increment `k`
- If element equals `val`, skip it (only increment `i`)
- Result: all valid elements are packed at the front, `k` is the count

```text
nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

i=0, k=0: nums[0]=3 equals val, skip (k stays 0)
i=1, k=0: nums[1]=2, copy to nums[0], k becomes 1
i=2, k=1: nums[2]=2, copy to nums[1], k becomes 2  
i=3, k=2: nums[3]=3 equals val, skip (k stays 2)

Result: nums = [2,2,2,3], k=2
```

Notice that `nums[k++] = nums[i]` is safe because `k <= 1` always (slow never overtakes fast)

```ts
function removeElement(nums: number[], val: number): number {
  let k = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== val) {
      nums[k++] = nums[i];
    }
  }

  return k;
}
```

```go
func removeElement(nums []int, val int) int {
	k := 0

	for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
		if nums[i] != val {
			nums[k] = nums[i]
			k++
		}
	}

	return k
}
```

Time Complexity: O(n) | Iterate through the array once.
Space Complexity: O(1) | No extra space is used.


## Solution 2: Two-Pointer (Opposite direction)

This uses two-pointer opposite-direction technique.

- Left points at the start of the array
- Right points at the end of the array
- We iterate while left <= right
- When `nums[left] === val`, we swap it with `nums[right]` and decrement `right`
- We don't increment `left` yet - we check the swapped value next iteration
- If the swapped value (originally `nums[right]`) is also `val`, we'll swap it again with the new `right-1`
- This continues until we 
  - either get a non-val value at left (then increment left)
  - or left > right (done)

```ts
function removeElement(nums: number[], val: number): number {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    if (nums[left] === val) {
      nums[left] = nums[right];
      right--;
    } else {
      left++;
    }
  }

  return left;
}

```
