543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Companies

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1

 

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100

  val: number;

    this.left = left === undefined ? null : left;
    this.right = right === undefined ? null : right;
