# Second Highest Salary

## Solution

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
```

- Inner query finds the highest salary
- Outer query finds the highest salary that is less than the highest salary
- If none exists, returns `null`
