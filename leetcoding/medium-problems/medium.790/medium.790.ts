790. Domino and Tromino Tiling

You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.


Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The five different ways are show above.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000

function numTilings(n: number): number {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (n === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  if (n === 2) {
    return 2;
  }

  const MOD = 1000000007;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  dp[0] = 1;
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;

  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] * 2 + dp[i - 3]) % MOD;
  }

  return dp[n];
}
